            <h2>ðŸŒ¸ Lei ðŸŒ¸</h2>
            <p>I am Lalainne Andaya, but my friends and family call me <i>Lei</i>. I am currently a second year student
                at Asia Pacific College, taking BSIT with a specialization in Mobile Internet Technologies. I was a graduate 
                of APC-SHS as part of batch 2023, and I took STEM-IT as my SHS track. 
                <br><br>
                During my stay at APC as a senior high school student, I found myself enjoying what we did which made me decide
                to take the same path for college. And during those years, including the current experience I have, I, along with my 
                teammates have created a couple of webpages for our projects. We were also able to create a game using python back in 12th
                grade. It was a fun experience, but it made me realize that game development is not for me. 
            </p>

        <div class="hidden-content" id="goals">
            <h2>ðŸŒ  Goals ðŸŒ </h2>
            <p>
                My short-term goals include excelling in my studies, improving my technical skills, 
                and creating more projects to build my portfolio. It is also my goal to pass all my courses with flying colors, graduate on time,
                and graduate with latin honors. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned briefly, I like the color pink. I like it so much that almost everything that I own is in that color. 
                I have been <i>into K-Pop</i>> since 2017 and I am into groups such as BTS, Seventeen, XG, and Izna. Back in 2022 to 2023, I used
                to <i>collect photocards</i> which are inclusions in K-Pop albums. I used to have more than 3 dozen photocards of my biases, but I
                decided to let them go and only kept my top 5 most favorite photocards.
                <br><br>
                Recently, whenever I'm stressed or feeling overwhelmed, I <i>like making paper stars</i>. It calms me down and eases my mind. I also find
                doing my <i>makeup</i> therapeutic. I have been into makeup only since the first quarter of last year, and since then I have been 
                building my collection bit by bit. Besides all these, I have also been into <i>running</i>. I started it for one of 
                our courses, but I now do it because I enjoy it.
